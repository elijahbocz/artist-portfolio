Chase and Brooke Lawrence are an American-based husband and wife artist duo. The Lawrences are sculptors and oil painters, best known for their ghastly and poignant style. Keeping with the methods and techniques of the Old Masters, they interchangeably work on every piece together to create highly ornamental and imposing pieces of art. Their work aims to explore new expressions of contemporary portraiture, esoteric philosophy and symbology,  landscape, and allegory with an immediately recognizable, familiar aesthetic.
