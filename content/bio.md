This is the deprecated version of [BCLawrence.art](https://bclawrence.art) built by Elijah Bocz for Brooke and Chase Lawrence. 
Images are provided with permission by artists for demonstration purposes.

Gatsby is used to create a static site that is deployed on Netlify.
Cloudinary is utilized for serving the images in conjunction with provided Gatsby plugins.
A CMS is available using Netlify credentials which allows for new images to be uploaded by the artist, and a new build is triggered through continuous deployment on Netfliy.
